# Motivaing question:
# Is there an observable difference in baby weight for smokers / non-smokers?

# Install/library the `openintro package
# install.packages('openintro')
library(openintro)

# You should now be able to `View` the `births` dataset


# What are the mean birth weights for smokers/non-smokers


# Store smokers/non-smokers in separate variables for easier access


# Make an overlapping histogram of the birth weights of smokers/non-smokers


# Pre-t-test conceptaul question: is this data paired?


# Let's calculate the t value and confidence intervals manually


# Compute CIs using t threshold


# Implement a t-test to confirm our results
